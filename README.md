A distributed key-value store written in Haskell

## Usage
-TODO: write up usage instructions

## Building a Distributed Key-Value Store
_This project is based on an exercise from Simon Marlow's
Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell_

-Central to doing anything with the `Control.Distributed.Process`
package, is the `Process` monad. A `Process` is analogous to a
Thread, it has ProcessID and can operate concurrently with other
Processes. Unlike threads, it operates within the `Process` monad
as opposed to the `IO` monad - though `Process` is an instance of
`MonadIO` allowing use of IO functions within the `Process` monad.
The `Process` Monad allows for compl
-Some parallels to the Control.Concurrent package
-Much as forkIO is needed to create a newthread,
`spawn` is used to start a new process, given the
id of a node and a closure around a process.
```
spawn nid $(mkStaticClosure `datastore)
```
-The `set` and `get` commands take a given key and use channels
to interact with the datastore. Like with MVars/TVars, these channels
can carry messages to and from a specific `Process`, possibly updating
that `Process`
-`set` and `get` functions
